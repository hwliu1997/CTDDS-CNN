## Installation
The code was developed using Python 3.5 & TensorFlow 1.9.0 & CUDA 9.0. 

## Code v1.0
Currently, we release our research code for testing. It should produce the same results as in the paper under default configuration.
## Testing
* It's easy to understand testing functions and to test your own data.
* An example of test usage is shown as follows:
```bash 
python test.py
```
